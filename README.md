The following project is meant to solve the slack code challenge for the interview.

## Description

This code should have the following:

* Access a public API and successfully retrieve data from it;
* Display that data on a page;
* Update the UI of a page without refreshing;
* Build a polished user experience you'd be proud to ship; and
* Do all of the above using only native JavaScript (no libraries such as jQuery, although CSS preprocessors are fine).
* I'd like you to create a web page that shows a grid of photo thumbnails; when a thumbnail is clicked, the photo should be displayed in a lightbox view, with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display the photo title. You can use any public API that returns photos; here are some ideas:
    * Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photosets.getPhotos.html
    * Google Image Search: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview
* It should run without errors in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE.
